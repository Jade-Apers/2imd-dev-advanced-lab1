        <h1>Hi! We are Fien, Jade and Yanelle.</h1>
        <h2>Curious about what we would like to build during this year?</h2>
        <p>There are so many options! At first, we didn't know what to pick. A chat bot, game, app... But we made our decision!</p>

        <h2>The Ultimate Dilemma App!</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>We would like to build an app where we can play with different people at the same time! The idea of the app is that everyone is presented with different dilemmas on their own device. You then have to answer these individually on your own device. Everyone's answer will then appear live on the screen of your fellow players!
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Who would play the game?</h3>
            <p>The game can be played by anyone! You can choose to play with your friend, or you can even play on your own and receive answers from people all over the world! Choose a topic on which you want to answer dilemmas and decide how you want to play the game!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Where can I download it and how much does is cost?</h3>
            <p>The app is available on the App Store and the Google Play Store! It is totally free, so have fun! </p>
